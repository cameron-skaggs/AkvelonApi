# AkvelonApi
An application that grabs branches from the App Center API UWP Application, builds them and prints the results of the builds once they complete.

To run this program clone the repo.
Before running do the following:
Important Note: Because I don't wish to publish the API token I've put a placeholder text in the field XApiToken.
The variable can be found under AkvelonApi/ApiApp/ApiHelper.cs. The variable is called XApiToken.
Contact me at cameronjskaggs@gmail.com and I will provide you with the token. Replace the text PLACEHOLDER with the token.

After this is done, run the program. The results will be printed to the console.
